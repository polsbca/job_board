## 2. Branch Strategy

* **main** â€“ always deployable / production-ready.
* **develop** â€“ integration branch for features; may be unstable.
* **feature/**`short-description` â€“ new features or large refactors.
* **bugfix/**`short-description` â€“ bug fixes.
* **hotfix/**`short-description` â€“ critical production fixes.

> Use kebab-case for branch names.

## 3. Coding Standards

* **PHP:** Follow **PSR-12**. Auto-format with `composer pint`.
* **JavaScript / Blade:** Use **Prettier** (configured in `package.json`).
* **Commit only formatted code.** A pre-commit hook is provided via Husky to run Pint & Prettier.

## 4. Commit Messages

Use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) style:

```
<type>(scope?): <subject>

<body>
```

Example:
```

```

Allowed `<type>` values: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.

## 5. Pull Requests

1. Rebase onto `develop` before opening the PR.
2. Ensure the CI pipeline passes (tests + lint).
3. Provide a clear description, screenshots/GIFs, and link related issues.
4. At least one reviewer approval is required.

---

## 6. Running Tests

```bash
php artisan test
npm run test   # if frontend tests are added
```

Generate coverage:
```bash
php artisan test --coverage-html=storage/coverage
```

---

## 7. Static Analysis & Linting

```bash
composer pint   # PHP formatter / linter
npm run lint    # ESLint / Prettier
```

---

## 8. Security Policy

Report vulnerabilities by email to **security@example.com** or open a private GitHub security advisory. Do **not** create public issues for security problems.
